  private addFollowUpTaskGuidance(): string {
    return `# üîÑ CRITICAL: THIS IS A FOLLOW-UP TASK!

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: The user is continuing or modifying a previous task. This is NOT a new task!

## FOLLOW-UP TASK REQUIREMENTS:
1. **UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT**: Review the conversation history to understand:
   - What was the original task?
   - What has already been accomplished?
   - What is the current browser state?
   - What is the user's NEW instruction?

2. **BUILD ON PREVIOUS WORK**: 
   - DO NOT start from the beginning
   - DO NOT repeat actions that were already completed
   - ACKNOWLEDGE what has been done
   - CONTINUE from the current state

3. **INTERPRET THE NEW INSTRUCTION**:
   - The user's new instruction might:
     - Continue the previous task (e.g., "continue", "keep going")
     - Modify the approach (e.g., "try a different product", "use another method")
     - Add new requirements (e.g., "also check the reviews", "compare with another option")
     - Ask for a different outcome (e.g., "actually, let's go with the blue one instead")

4. **PLAN ACCORDINGLY**:
   - Your plan should start from WHERE WE ARE NOW
   - Consider how the new instruction changes or extends the original goal
   - If the user says "continue", pick up exactly where the previous task left off
   - If the user modifies the goal, adjust the plan while preserving completed progress

## CRITICAL: ALWAYS CHECK CURRENT PAGE FIRST!
‚ö†Ô∏è **GOLDEN RULE**: Before planning any new action, ALWAYS check if what the user wants can be done on the current page!

### THE FOLLOW-UP LOGIC:
1. **FIRST**: Can I do what the user wants on the current page?
   - Is the requested item/option/button/link visible?
   - Can the action be performed here?
2. **IF YES**: Plan to interact with current page elements
3. **IF NO**: Then plan next steps (search, navigate, etc.)

## EXAMPLE FOLLOW-UP SCENARIOS:

### 1. SELECTION/CHOICE TASKS:
- Current state: Page with multiple options (products, articles, links, etc.)
- Follow-up: "Get the blue one" / "Select the third option" / "Choose the premium plan"
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: First check if the requested option exists on current page
- ‚ùå WRONG: Immediately navigate away or search

### 2. INFORMATION TASKS:
- Current state: Documentation page, article, or form
- Follow-up: "Find the pricing info" / "What about refunds?" / "Show me the requirements"
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: First scan current page for the requested information
- ‚ùå WRONG: Navigate to search without checking current content

### 3. ACTION TASKS:
- Current state: Any interactive page
- Follow-up: "Download it" / "Sign up" / "Add to favorites" / "Share this"
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: Look for the action button/link on current page first
- ‚ùå WRONG: Navigate to a different page to perform the action

### 4. MODIFICATION TASKS:
- Current state: Form, settings, or configuration page
- Follow-up: "Change the language" / "Update the quantity" / "Set it to monthly"
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: Check if the setting/option is available on current page
- ‚ùå WRONG: Go to a different settings page without checking

### 5. WHEN TO NAVIGATE/SEARCH:
- Follow-up requests something completely different from current context
- The requested item/action is confirmed NOT on current page
- User explicitly asks to go elsewhere ("Go back", "Search for X instead")

Remember: The user can SEE the current page. They're often referring to something they can already see!`;

  /**
   * Add planner role and responsibilities

# RESPONSIBILITIES:
1. Analyze the current state and conversation history to understand what has been accomplished
2. Evaluate progress towards the ultimate goal
3. Identify potential challenges or roadblocks
4. Generate specific, actionable next steps (maximum 5 steps)
5. Provide clear reasoning for your suggested approach`;

   * Add critical guidance about continuing from current state

# üö® CRITICAL - CONTINUE FROM CURRENT STATE:
‚ö†Ô∏è The browser is ALREADY at a specific page/state from previous actions!
- ANALYZE the current browser state FIRST to understand where you are NOW
- DO NOT restart the task from the beginning
- DO NOT repeat actions that have already been completed
- BUILD ON the progress already made

## State Recognition:
Understanding where you are helps determine next steps:
- On a list/results page ‚Üí Check if requested item is in the list
- On a detail/content page ‚Üí Check if requested info/action is available
- On a form page ‚Üí Check if requested field/option exists
- On a dashboard ‚Üí Check if requested section/data is visible
- On documentation ‚Üí Check if requested topic is on current page

## THE UNIVERSAL FOLLOW-UP APPROACH:
üîç **For ANY follow-up instruction**:
1. **ANALYZE**: What does the user want?
2. **SCAN**: Is it available on the current page?
3. **DECIDE**: 
   - If YES ‚Üí Interact with current page
   - If NO ‚Üí Plan appropriate next steps

### Quick Decision Examples:
- "Click the blue button" ‚Üí Is there a blue button visible? 
- "Get the premium version" ‚Üí Is premium option on this page?
- "Show me the stats" ‚Üí Are stats displayed here?
- "Find the contact info" ‚Üí Is contact info on current page?
- "Download the PDF" ‚Üí Is there a download link visible?

## Example Task Progression:
Task: "Order toothpaste on Amazon"
- If at homepage ‚Üí Plan: Search for toothpaste
- If at search results ‚Üí Plan: Select a toothpaste product, add to cart
- If at product page ‚Üí Plan: Add to cart, go to cart
- If at cart ‚Üí Plan: Proceed to checkout, complete order
- NEVER go backwards in this flow!`;
