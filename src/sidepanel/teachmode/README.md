This is the complete implementation of the Teach Mode UI based on the design document.

## File Structure

```

  TeachMode.tsx                 # Main container orchestrating all screens
  TeachModeHome.tsx            # Home screen with recordings list

  TeachModeDetail.tsx          # Recording detail view
  TeachModeExecution.tsx       # Live execution progress
  TeachModeSummary.tsx         # Execution results

  components/
    EmptyState.tsx             # Empty state for no recordings
    RecordingCard.tsx          # Recording card in list
    StepCard.tsx               # Step in recording timeline
    StepTimeline.tsx           # Timeline of steps in detail view
    VoiceIndicator.tsx         # Voice recording indicator
    ProcessingStages.tsx       # Processing progress stages

  teachmode.store.ts           # Zustand store with dummy data
  teachmode.types.ts           # TypeScript types
  teachmode.utils.ts           # Utility functions
  index.ts                     # Export file
```

## Usage

To use the TeachMode in your sidepanel app:

```tsx
import { TeachMode } from '@/sidepanel/teachmode'

function App() {
  const [view, setView] = useState('chat')

  return (
    <div>
      {view === 'teach' ? (
        <TeachMode onBack={() => setView('chat')} />
      ) : (
        <ChatView />
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Features Implemented

✅ All 7 screens from the design document
✅ Empty state with examples
✅ Recording cards with long-press delete
✅ Intent capture with suggestions
✅ Live recording with timeline and voice indicator
✅ Processing animation with staged progress
✅ Recording detail view with expandable steps
✅ Live execution progress
✅ Success/failure summary screens
✅ Dummy data for testing
✅ All animations (recording pulse, border glow)
✅ Responsive layout for side panel
✅ Tailwind CSS styling matching existing theme
✅ Zustand store for state management

## Chrome Extension Integration

The components are ready for Chrome extension integration. They listen for these messages:
- `TEACH_MODE_START` - Start recording
- `TEACH_MODE_STOP` - Stop recording
- `TEACH_MODE_EVENT_CAPTURED` - Receive captured events
- `TEACH_MODE_EXECUTION_UPDATE` - Execution progress

## Next Steps

1. Integrate with Chrome extension background script
2. Implement actual Chrome browserOS APIs
3. Connect to AI processing pipeline
4. Add real screenshot capture
5. Implement voice recording with Web Audio API
