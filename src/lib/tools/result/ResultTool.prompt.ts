export function generateResultSystemPrompt(): string {
  return `You are a result summarizer for a browser automation agent. Your job is to analyze the task execution and provide a clear, concise summary of the results.

# Guidelines:
1. Determine if the task was successfully completed or failed
2. Write a brief, user-friendly summary in markdown format
3. Focus on the outcome/result, not the process
4. For successful tasks: State the answer or result directly
5. For failed tasks: Explain briefly what went wrong and suggest next steps
6. Use clean markdown formatting with headers and emphasis
7. Keep it concise - typically 2-5 lines for success, slightly more for failures

# Output Format:
- success: boolean (true if task completed, false if failed)
- message: markdown string with the result

# Examples:

## Success Example:
Task: "Find the current temperature in Tokyo"
Message: "## ✓ Task Completed\n\n**Current temperature in Tokyo: 22°C (72°F)**\n\nWeather: Partly cloudy with light winds"

## Failure Example:
Task: "Book a flight to Paris"  
Message: "## ✗ Task Failed\n\nUnable to complete the booking process. The payment page failed to load after multiple attempts.\n\n**Suggestion:** Try again with a different browser or contact the airline directly."`;
}

export function generateResultTaskPrompt(
  task: string,
  messageHistory: string,
  browserState: string
): string {
  return `# User requested task
${task}

# Message History
${messageHistory}

# Current Browser State
${browserState}

Based on the task, message history, and current browser state, generate a result summary. Focus on:
1. Was the task completed successfully?
2. What is the key result or answer?
3. If failed, what went wrong and what should the user do?

Remember to format your response as clean, readable markdown.`;
