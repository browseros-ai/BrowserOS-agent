export const refreshStateToolDescription = `CRITICAL TOOL - Updates the browser state in your conversation context to reflect the current page after navigation or interactions.

WHEN TO USE:
- IMMEDIATELY AFTER: Major page changes (navigation, form submission, clicking links)
- BEFORE: Planning or validation steps if browser state seems outdated
- WHEN: You need to verify the current page matches your expectations
- IF STRUGGLING: When actions are failing repeatedly - refresh to get accurate page information

WHY IT'S CRITICAL:
Without calling this tool regularly, you will be working with STALE, OUTDATED page information that no longer reflects reality.

Remember: The browser state in your context does NOT update automatically. You MUST call this tool to see changes.`
